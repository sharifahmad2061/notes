# `Where` Clause

-   The where clause is optional in a SQL select statement.
-   It is used to apply conditions on columns and can do so on multiple columns such as:

```
SELECT * FROM games WHERE list_price < 10
```

-   This is mainly used to filter rows based on conditions applied to certain columns.
