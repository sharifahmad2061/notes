# Git

- Git has 3 internal state management mechanisms, which are:
  - The working Directory
  - The Staging Index
  - The Commit Tree (HEAD)
- sometimes these mechanisms are called `Git's Three Trees ğŸŒ³ğŸŒ³ğŸŒ³`. They are not however traditional tree datastructures, rather `node and pointer-based data structures`, that git uses to track a timeline of edits.
