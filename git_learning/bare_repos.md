# Bare Repository

- bare repos don't have any working directory.
- bare repositories are ones which don't have any checkout branch, this is essentialy how github repositories work, that's why we need to make pull request to them.
- bare repo can't push to non-bare repo, because non-bare repos have checkout branches and force pushing into them, can change the working directory that is why its recommended to pull from the bare repo.
